The aim of this project to master the basics of Machine Learning by implementing the project "CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION"

The 5 stages of the project determined is:

1. Problem Definition & ML Framing

What task is this?
Supervised or Unsupervised?
What matters most?
(Recall > precision)

2.EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

1. Understand data structure
2. Detect imbalance
3. See patterns (scatter, PCA, boxplots)
4. Basic insights

3. Data Preparation / Preprocessing

1. Train-test split (stratified)
2. Scaling (SVM/Other models need it)
3. Feature engineering (log transforms, PCA optional)
4. Class balancing or class weighting

4. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

1. Picking algorithms
2. Training baseline
3. Tuning C, gamma, depth, trees, learning rate etc.
4. Comparing performance

5.Evaluation, Interpretation, & Model Selection

1. Metrics 
2. Trade-off reasoning
3. Business choice vs raw scores
4. Documenting why a model was chosen
